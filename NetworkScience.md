This Task View contains information about using R to obtain, parse, manipulate, create, and visualize network data. Network data generally consists of a collection of entites and connections between them.

Unless otherwise mentioned, all packages presented with hyperlinks are available from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

If you have any comments or suggestions for additions or improvements for this Task View, go to GitHub and [submit an issue](https://github.com/erictleung/networkscience/issues), or make some changes and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/erictleung/networkscience/pulls). If you canâ€™t contribute on GitHub, send Eric Leung an email . If you have an issue with one of the packages discussed below, please contact the maintainer of that package.
